| Vector with S3 (direct) | ~5:1 | $0.0046 |
| Elasticsearch (hot tier) | ~3:1 | $0.062 |
| Elasticsearch UltraWarm | ~3:1 | $0.008 |

### Realistic Cost Scenarios

#### Scenario: 1TB of daily logs, 30-day retention

| Solution | Monthly Storage Cost | Notes |
|----------|----------------------|-------|
| OpenObserve with S3 | ~$690 | 30TB of raw logs = ~3TB stored |
| Vector with S3 (direct) | ~$1,380 | 30TB of raw logs = ~6TB stored |
| Elasticsearch (hot tier) | ~$5,580 | 30TB of raw logs = ~10TB stored + EBS overhead |
| Elasticsearch with UltraWarm | ~$2,160 | 1TB hot, 9TB UltraWarm storage |

#### Scenario: 5TB of daily logs, 90-day retention

| Solution | Monthly Storage Cost | Notes |
|----------|----------------------|-------|
| OpenObserve with S3 | ~$10,350 | 450TB of raw logs = ~45TB stored |
| Vector with S3 (direct) | ~$20,700 | 450TB of raw logs = ~90TB stored |
| Elasticsearch (hot tier) | ~$83,700 | 450TB of raw logs = ~150TB stored + EBS overhead |
| Elasticsearch with UltraWarm/Cold | ~$32,400 | 5TB hot, 45TB UltraWarm, 100TB Cold Storage |

## Compute Cost Comparison

### Required Infrastructure

| Solution | Compute Requirements | Monthly Compute Cost (estimated) |
|----------|----------------------|----------------------------------|
| OpenObserve | Minimal (2-4 instances) | $500-1,000 |
| Vector | Minimal (agent deployment) | $300-800 |
| Elasticsearch | Significant (6+ instances) | $2,000-5,000 |

### Query Performance vs Cost

| Solution | Query Cost Model | Cost for 1,000 daily queries |
|----------|------------------|------------------------------|
| OpenObserve | Pay for compute only | Low (included in compute cost) |
| Vector + S3 | Need additional query layer | N/A (not a query engine) |
| Elasticsearch | Pay for always-on compute | High (included in high compute cost) |

## Total Cost of Ownership Analysis

### Small Organization (1TB daily, 30-day retention)

| Solution | Monthly Storage | Monthly Compute | Total Monthly Cost |
|----------|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| OpenObserve | $690 | $700 | $1,390 |
| Vector + S3 + Query Layer | $1,380 | $800 | $2,180 |
| Elasticsearch | $5,580 | $2,500 | $8,080 |
| Elasticsearch (optimized tiers) | $2,160 | $2,200 | $4,360 |

### Large Organization (5TB daily, 90-day retention)

| Solution | Monthly Storage | Monthly Compute | Total Monthly Cost |
|----------|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| OpenObserve | $10,350 | $1,800 | $12,150 |
| Vector + S3 + Query Layer | $20,700 | $2,000 | $22,700 |
| Elasticsearch | $83,700 | $5,000 | $88,700 |
| Elasticsearch (optimized tiers) | $32,400 | $4,500 | $36,900 |

## Hidden Costs and Considerations

### Data Transfer Costs

- **Internal AWS traffic**: Generally minimal within same region
- **External data transfer**: Can add significant costs for user queries
- **OpenObserve and Vector**: More efficient protocols can reduce transfer costs

### Operational Overhead

| Solution | Operational Complexity | FTE Cost Equivalent |
|----------|------------------------|---------------------|
| OpenObserve | Low | 0.2-0.5 FTE |
| Vector | Medium | 0.3-0.7 FTE |
| Elasticsearch | High | 0.7-1.5 FTE |

### Scaling Costs

| Solution | Scaling Pattern | Cost Increase Pattern |
|----------|-----------------|------------------------|
| OpenObserve | Near-linear with data volume | Gradual |
| Vector | Near-linear with data volume | Gradual |
| Elasticsearch | Exponential with data volume | Steep jumps |

## Cost Optimization Strategies

### For OpenObserve

1. Use S3 lifecycle policies to transition older data to cheaper storage tiers
2. Implement aggressive data retention policies
3. Use efficient data shipping with compression

### For Vector

1. Implement client-side filtering to reduce data volume
2. Use batch uploads to S3 to reduce API calls
3. Consider lambda-based processing for variable workloads

### For Elasticsearch

1. Use UltraWarm and Cold Storage aggressively
2. Implement index lifecycle management
3. Consider data rollups for historical data
4. Use appropriate instance types for workload

## Conclusion

Based on pure cost analysis:

1. **OpenObserve** offers the most cost-effective solution for organizations of all sizes, especially those with high log volumes.

2. **Vector with S3** provides good cost efficiency for storage but requires additional components for a complete solution.

3. **Elasticsearch** is significantly more expensive, though costs can be somewhat mitigated through careful use of storage tiers.

For most cost-conscious organizations, OpenObserve with S3 backend provides the optimal balance of functionality and cost-efficiency.
