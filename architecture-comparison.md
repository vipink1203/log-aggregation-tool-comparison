## Conclusion

From a technical architecture perspective:

1. **OpenObserve** offers the most integrated S3-native solution, with purpose-built architecture for log data on cloud object storage, but has more limited data collection capabilities.

2. **Vector** provides exceptional performance and flexibility as a data router and collector, but requires additional components for a complete solution.

3. **Elasticsearch on AWS** offers a mature but complex architecture where S3 integration is added as a secondary feature, and requires third-party collection tools.

4. **Elastic.co** provides the most comprehensive end-to-end solution with advanced features and excellent data collection capabilities through its Beats and Elastic Agent, but with higher complexity and cost.

For organizations looking to leverage S3 as a primary backend for log storage, OpenObserve's architecture provides the most direct and efficient approach, while Vector offers the highest performance data collection and shipping capabilities. For enterprises requiring advanced features and comprehensive data collection, Elastic.co provides the most complete solution, especially when leveraging the Frozen Tier for S3 integration.
