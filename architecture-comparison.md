# Technical Architecture Comparison

This document compares the architectural approaches of OpenObserve, Vector, and Elastic from a technical perspective, with a focus on S3 integration capabilities.

## OpenObserve Architecture

### Core Components

OpenObserve is built as a modern, cloud-native observability platform with the following key components:

1. **Ingestion Layer**
   - Accepts data via HTTP, FluentBit, Vector, and other collectors
   - Supports multiple protocols and formats
   - Built-in schema detection and validation

2. **Storage Engine**
   - Columnar storage architecture (similar to ClickHouse)
   - Native S3 integration as primary storage
   - Local disk buffer for performance
   - Parquet file format for efficient storage and querying

3. **Query Engine**
   - SQL-compatible query language
   - Distributed query execution
   - Push-down optimization for S3 queries
   - Real-time and historical data querying

4. **User Interface**
   - Built-in dashboards
   - Alert management
   - Trace visualization
   - Log explorer

### S3 Integration

OpenObserve's S3 integration is a core architectural feature:

- **Direct Write to S3**: Data is written directly to S3 after processing
- **Read Optimization**: Uses metadata and indexes to minimize S3 API calls
- **Tiered Storage**: Combines local storage for hot data with S3 for historical data
- **Compatible Storage**: Works with S3, MinIO, GCS, and Azure Blob

### Deployment Options

- **Single Binary**: Self-contained binary for simple deployments
- **Docker**: Containerized deployment
- **Kubernetes**: Helm charts for orchestrated deployments
- **Cloud**: Managed service option

## Vector Architecture

### Core Components

Vector is designed as a high-performance data pipeline with these components:

1. **Sources**
   - Log file tailing
   - Syslog receivers
   - Metrics collection
   - AWS service integrations (including S3)
   - HTTP endpoints

2. **Transforms**
   - Parsing and structuring
   - Filtering and routing
   - Aggregation and sampling
   - Enrichment with external data

3. **Sinks**
   - S3 and other object stores
   - Log analytics platforms
   - Metrics systems
   - Alerting systems
   - Custom HTTP endpoints

### Deployment Patterns

Vector can be deployed in several ways:

1. **Agent Mode**
   - Runs alongside applications
   - Collects local logs and metrics
   - Performs initial processing
   - Forwards to aggregators or directly to sinks

2. **Aggregator Mode**
   - Receives data from multiple agents
   - Performs centralized processing
   - Handles buffering and batching
   - Routes to final destinations

3. **Sidecar Mode**
   - Dedicated to single application
   - Tightly coupled with app lifecycle
   - Provides isolation between apps

4. **Serverless Mode**
   - Lambda-based processing
   - Event-driven execution
   - Pay-per-use model

### S3 Integration

Vector's S3 integration is comprehensive:

- **S3 as Source**: Can read logs directly from S3 buckets
- **S3 as Sink**: Efficiently writes processed data to S3
- **Format Options**: JSON, Parquet, Raw, etc.
- **Compression**: Supports GZIP, Snappy, Zstandard
- **Partitioning**: Time-based and metadata-based partitioning
- **Batching**: Configurable batching for efficient API usage

## Elasticsearch Architecture

### Core Components

Elasticsearch on AWS consists of:

1. **Data Nodes**
   - Store indexed data
   - Execute search and aggregation operations
   - Use EBS volumes for primary storage

2. **Master Nodes**
   - Manage cluster state
   - Handle routing
   - Coordinate operations

3. **Client Nodes**
   - Handle incoming requests
   - Distribute queries
   - Aggregate results

4. **Storage Tiers**
   - Hot: EBS-backed storage for active data
   - UltraWarm: S3-backed for less frequently accessed data
   - Cold Storage: S3-backed for archival data

5. **Kibana**
   - Visualization platform
   - Dashboard creation
   - Advanced analytics

### S3 Integration

AWS Elasticsearch (OpenSearch) S3 integration:

- **UltraWarm Storage**: S3-backed storage tier that maintains searchability
- **Snapshot Repository**: S3 buckets for cluster backups
- **Cold Storage**: Low-cost S3 archival with on-demand rehydration
- **Index State Management**: Automated data lifecycle across tiers

## Architectural Recommendations

### Small to Medium Deployments

For smaller deployments (< 100GB/day):
- **OpenObserve**: Best all-in-one solution
- **Vector + S3**: Good for forwarding to existing analytics platforms

### Large Deployments

For larger deployments (> 1TB/day):
- **Vector as collector + OpenObserve as backend**: Optimal balance of performance and cost
- **Vector + S3 + specialty query engine**: For specific use cases with custom requirements

### Enterprise Deployments

For enterprise requirements:
- **Elasticsearch with tiered storage**: When advanced search and security features are required
- **Hybrid approach**: Vector collection with selective routing to both OpenObserve and Elasticsearch

## Technical Integration Considerations

### Data Shipping Patterns

1. **Agent-based Collection**
   - OpenObserve: Built-in or FluentBit/Vector agents
   - Vector: Native agent deployment
   - Elasticsearch: Beats or Fluentd agents

2. **Direct API Ingestion**
   - OpenObserve: REST API, bulk API
   - Vector: HTTP source
   - Elasticsearch: REST API, bulk API

3. **Serverless Integration**
   - OpenObserve: Lambda function support
   - Vector: Lambda execution model
   - Elasticsearch: Requires additional components

### S3 Access Patterns

| Solution | Read Pattern | Write Pattern | API Utilization |
|----------|--------------|---------------|-----------------|
| OpenObserve | Optimized selective reads | Direct writes | Efficient |
| Vector | Streaming reads | Batched writes | Very Efficient |
| Elasticsearch | Bulk imports | Snapshot exports | Potentially inefficient |

## Conclusion

From a technical architecture perspective:

1. **OpenObserve** offers the most integrated S3-native solution, with purpose-built architecture for log data on cloud object storage.

2. **Vector** provides exceptional performance and flexibility as a data router, but requires additional components for a complete solution.

3. **Elasticsearch on AWS** offers a mature but complex architecture where S3 integration is added as a secondary feature rather than a core design principle.

For organizations looking to leverage S3 as a primary backend for log storage, OpenObserve's architecture provides the most direct and efficient approach, while Vector offers the highest performance data collection and shipping capabilities.
